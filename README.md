# About
This is a simple datalake - `CRUD` - used to store photos. It's used by other small project(s) as part of a machine learning playground that downloads photos from a 3rd party source, stores them here and then builds dataset for computer vision tasks. The structure of the project is microservices-like so this is just one part.

# PT_Datalake
The project uses a simple `REST` framework (`Javalin`) and simple `SQLite` framework (`Exposed`) for faster iteration and improvements.

# Other
The rest of the projects would be listed here with very short descriptions.
